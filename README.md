# Homework Repository

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks related to least squares fitting. The tasks focus on extrapolating trends from real-world datasets.

## Homework Overview

### 1. NVIDIA Stock Price Analysis
In this assignment, you will work through a Jupyter notebook to analyse NVIDIA stock price data and determine the line of best fit. You will then use this best-fit line to predict the value of NVIDIA's stock on 1st January 2025. 

Key tasks:
- Determine the line of best fit to the stock price data.
- Predict the stock price for 1st January 2025 based on the identified trend.
- Reflect on the accuracy of extrapolating from past data:
  - Why might the trend not continue?
  - What are the caveats to using a line of best fit for future predictions?

You can launch the notebook on Binder to easily run the analysis in an interactive environment.

### 2. Taylor Swift Ticket Sales Analysis
This second task involves analysing a dataset on Taylor Swiftâ€™s ticket sales over several of her tours. With only six data points, you are tasked with determining the line of best fit using either manual calculations or by modifying a provided Jupyter notebook.

Key tasks:
- Calculate the best-fit line coefficients (`m` and `c`) either manually (using formulae from the lecture) or by modifying the skeleton Jupyter notebook.
- Plot the data points and the best-fit line.
- Comment on any outliers or anomalies in the data and how they affect the best-fit line.

## Instructions for Use

1. **NVIDIA Stock Price Analysis**: Open the notebook `nvidia_stock_analysis.ipynb` in Binder to run the analysis. The notebook will guide you through the steps needed to calculate the line of best fit and make a stock price prediction.
2. **Taylor Swift Ticket Sales Analysis**: Use the `taylor_swift_sales_analysis.ipynb` notebook (or calculate manually) to find the best-fit line for the ticket sales data. You can modify the provided notebook to perform the analysis or calculate by hand and plot the results in the notebook.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries**: Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`

If you're working locally, you can install these by running:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
